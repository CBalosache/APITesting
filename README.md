# APITesting

Created 15 different test cases for the Hearthstone API.
The test cases check the fuctionality of the API to see if the data is displayed in the proper format (application/json) and for any changes made to the headers. 
For example: if the number of headers is the same as the original one, or if a header name has changed, or a new one has been added).
